<blockquote>
<p>Summary Tips</p>
<ul>
<li>Your mindset have to be changed from “I need the job” to “how will I contribute to the company’s mission and success”</li>
<li>Always continue to learn the German language (Its your <em>competitive advantage</em> over English speaking applicants with equal&#x2F;similar skills)</li>
<li>Apply with English CV and a <em>cover letter</em> for English speaking jobs and the same for German-speaking jobs (CV and cover letter in German). <em>Don’t hesitate</em> to write a cover letter dedicated specifically for the company.</li>
<li>Write your CV <em>with care</em>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Over the past year, our company did lay-offs, and as a Blue card holder, was difficult for me to be in a new job for several reasons (the high competition for English-speaking jobs and the lack of the German language). I’ve applied to about 10s of companies (282 emails for the whole process, excluding subscription notifications, only communication with the companies), got rejections or no answer at all. In those 10s of applications, I had around 10 interviews (over a year period, I got only 2 offers, one in last November and one last week).The applications were submitted to job posting sites (e.g., LinkedIn, <a href="https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/">https://www.arbeitsagentur.de</a>, Glassdoor, Indeed, XING), in addition to sending emails individually to each Odoo partner in Germany that have open positions on their websites too (I work as a senior Odoo developer). </p>
<p>I’ve learned that there is a high competition among English-speaking jobs in the IT in general. It was the same situation for my friends who only knew English. It means that I need to get something different than the whole applicants whom are also applying at the same time. The difference here is the <em>language</em>. The German language. So, I continued learning my language month after month, took two B1 Telc exams and <em>failed</em> in both. That was in mid 2024. The frustration and getting depressed was prevailing. It is a psychological game. You always need to continue learning the language regardless the disturbances. </p>
<p>Here, I’ll list what’ve learned over the past year while applying to jobs in Germany.</p>
<h1 id="The-CV"><a href="#The-CV" class="headerlink" title="The CV"></a>The CV</h1><p>The format and structure of a CV is always fuzzy and no clear-cut lines defined. However, friends of mine send me a website, that was building very close CV to some <em>standard</em> German one here. The website is <a href="https://www.lebenslauf.de/">https://www.lebenslauf.de/</a>, where I also build my CV in last year. </p>
<p>And, last year, I was at <a href="https://jobs.heise.de/">Heise Jobs IT Tag</a>, where I took a free <em>professional photo session</em>, and I also got some notes about my CV, as shown below:</p>
<br>
<img src="/images/not-getting-a-new-job/Bsrukis-Lebenslauf-2024-notes.jpeg" loading="lazy"  />
<br>

<p>However, and after some iterations, I have changed my CV to look like this (both English and German versions):</p>
<br>
<img src="/images/not-getting-a-new-job/Bsruki_cv_en.jpeg" loading="lazy" width="298px" />
<img src="/images/not-getting-a-new-job/Bsruki_cv_de.jpeg" loading="lazy"  width="298px"/>
<br>

<p>As you can see, I included my picture in it. For each project, I try to limit it to maximum of 2 lines, but couldn’t. For me, it is important to show the timeline, so that it is easy for the person who is reading my CV to quickly recognize my years of experience. In addition, I also included the detailed version of my own experience as a link to my blog.</p>
<h1 id="Gaining-an-Interview"><a href="#Gaining-an-Interview" class="headerlink" title="Gaining an Interview"></a>Gaining an Interview</h1><p>I found out, that you have to apply as early as possible, and not delay it for more than a week. That also includes recruiters approaching you: don’t delay them.<br>And, when they ask for a cover letter, then <em>include it</em>. The cover letter is also important, as noted by some of the companies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“(Note: We prefer applications sent by email with a cover letter, as this helps us to get a better impression of your personality and motivation.)”<br><img src="/images/not-getting-a-new-job/cover-letter-company-note_blurred.png" loading="lazy" /><br><br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also use AI tools to create a cover letter for you, for example I have my own Odoo development experience written in this blog, and I use AI to create a cover letter out of it.</p>
<p>I highly recommend to read and search about the company, and what really interests you in them. You’re highly will be asked this question: <em>Why do you need to work with us?</em>  or <em>Why are you leaving your current company and join us?</em></p>
<h2 id="The-Mindset"><a href="#The-Mindset" class="headerlink" title="The Mindset"></a>The Mindset</h2><p>It is <em>NOT getting the job</em>. That is a completely shallow mindset. Rather it is about you being part with them, and how you’ll contribute to their mission and future. Its about <em>what value you’ll bring to the company?</em> That you have to put and motivate you to join them before the interview.<br>The other thing is about wether you’ll be accepted or rejected. You have to manage your expectations. Never expect you’ll go to the next interview, rather attend the interview with <em>I don’t care</em> mentality. As long as you desperately wants the job, <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/search/true-if-you-want-something-you-fDEsRoN9TrmuQI76If.YNQ">your brain will work against it</a>. </p>
<h1 id="At-the-Interview"><a href="#At-the-Interview" class="headerlink" title="At the Interview"></a>At the Interview</h1><p>The is the most critical part of the whole process. Now its your 30 - 60 minutes to show your personality. Yes, the first interview is about your personality and how you <em>sell</em> yourself. It is not about your skills, rather you have to show the soft-side of you, how you communicate, and interact with the interviewers. They ask you questions, you too ask them questions. It is a two-way exchange of information, and never waiting for them to always ask you.</p>
<h2 id="Common-questions-from-your-side"><a href="#Common-questions-from-your-side" class="headerlink" title="Common questions from your side"></a>Common questions from your side</h2><ul>
<li>What is the team structure I’ll be working with?</li>
<li>What will be more daily tasks or routine looks like?</li>
<li>The system version or if there are upgrades to it.</li>
<li>The job will be remote or I have to relocate to &lt;city..</li>
<li>What will be the next step or steps?</li>
<li>When will I get an answer from you?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Salary"><a href="#Salary" class="headerlink" title="Salary"></a>Salary</h3><p>This is <em>negotiation</em>. When you’ll be asked: “What is your salary expectation?” your answer will be based on how you think you <em>value</em> for them. For example, if you think you’re very good the skills you have then you can answer with a salary that is aligned with the market. Here in Germany, the juniors in IT starts with a salary of about 45k euros&#x2F;year, and you can check online what are the salary ranges for experienced positions looks like.</p>
<p>You can also ask them, “What is your budget?” and here either they’ll tell you a range or its not specified. If not specified, then pick a number that you really wants to have.</p>
<h1 id="Rejections-Reasons"><a href="#Rejections-Reasons" class="headerlink" title="Rejections Reasons"></a>Rejections Reasons</h1><ul>
<li>I delayed my task submission to be 1 hour before the deadline (always submit it as soon as possible)</li>
<li>I didn’t review some computer science technical terms and principles (e.g., what are software design patterns, or modern software architectures, relational vs non-relational databases, or even how to optimize a sql query)</li>
<li>Not good enough German language</li>
<li>“ In the end, we felt the other candidate was a closer fit for the role and showed a particularly high level of motivation to join Yoshi en.”</li>
<li>“Nach sorgfältiger interner Abstimmung sehen wir jedoch zu wenig Übereinstimmung zwischen Deinen Qualifikationen und unseren Anforderungen, so dass wir Dir leider absagen müssen.”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Short-Background"><a href="#Short-Background" class="headerlink" title="Short Background"></a>Short Background</h1><p>It is 2025 in Germany, and the IT jobs market for <em>English speakers</em> (like me) is highly competitive. Over the past year, I was constantly trying to find a new job, but either I got no answer or mostly rejections. With the introduction of Chancenkarte in June 2024, it gets worse.</p>
<p>I was applying to Odoo jobs every month, and barely getting an interview in 1 or 2 months. Last year, between June and December, I applied to about 50 Odoo developer jobs, and only getting 5 interviews. The last interview was end of October, where I was having in-person interview, whom I got the job (though they required B1). This job was even below my Blue card salary minimum requirements for 2025, but I continued with them, and later the immigration office didn’t disagree on this salary.<br>However, even while I was in the new job, was constantly applying for new jobs to find a better one. Between January 2025 and June 2025, I’ve had 3 interview, one of them I was so close to getting it if I was preparing for some computer science terms (e.g., design patterns, SOLID principles, etc…). </p>
<p>During this period, I was also enhancing my Germany language. I got my B1 Telc Certificate in April 2025, and at the same time, I started a private German session every Wednesday to continue the progress.</p>
<p>After July, I started applying for German speaking jobs, having my CV in German and also my cover letter in German. I had two German interviews, and both got rejected (one was that my German language is still not enough, and the other one was that my skills were not close to the job requirements).</p>
<p>In August, I had a third German interview, and I understand about 90% of what they said (except for the CEO, who out of a sudden spoke and I didn’t catch of what he was saying, maybe it was different accent 🤷🏻‍♂️). This interview, they moved me to the next interview, where I would have the technical interview to be at the company place. </p>
<p>In September, I also had two interviews: One in English, and another one was supposed to be in German, but we had it in English. The first English interview was very good, and even the interviewer was glad about it, but unfortunately, I got rejected! I thought I would get passed to the next interview, but my expectations were wrong, and I got frustrated about it a lot.<br>The next German interview, was supposed to be in German,  and before the interview starts, some negative thoughts about that it were already popping. I remember that I wanted to even ignore it, since I’ll be rejected anyway. But, once it starts, I was really with <em>I don’t care</em> mindset. They asked me, if English or German? and then I answered with <em>absolutely English</em>, and for somehow, I was very fluent and remembered many things that contributed to being with good impression on them. This interview was very good to me, and it is the second offer I get since last year (my first offer is the current company I am working on).</p>
<h1 id="In-the-End"><a href="#In-the-End" class="headerlink" title="In the End"></a>In the End</h1><p>Never stop learning! I wish for all of you to be in a company that is environment-friendly and you like working there and being part of their mission.<br>All the best of luck and <em>acceptance</em> 🙏🏼.</p>

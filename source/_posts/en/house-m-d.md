**Gregory House**, M.D., commonly referred to by his surname **House**, is the title character of the American medical drama series House. Created by David Shore and portrayed by English actor Hugh Laurie, he leads a team of diagnosticians as the Head of Diagnostic Medicine at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in Princeton, New Jersey (based on the real-life Yaleâ€“New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut).

House's character has been described as a misanthrope, cynic, narcissist, and curmudgeon, the last of which was named one of the top television words of 2005 in honor of the character. He is the only character to appear in all 177 episodes and, except for Wilson's brief appearance, is the only regular character to appear in the season six premiere.
